The banner picture is part of [Dr. Gaël McGill's](https://bcmp.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/gael-mcgill) brilliant 3D rendering of a eukaryotic cell cross-section, based on X-ray, NMR and cryo-electron microscopy data. It's just awesome.

题图是 [Gaël McGill](https://bcmp.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/gael-mcgill) 博士根据 X 射线衍射、核磁共振和冷冻电镜数据呈现的真核细胞切面渲染图的一部分。很棒不是吗。
